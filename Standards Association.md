# Standards Association

Created by: Shane Evans
Created time: February 14, 2024 9:11 PM

This proposal outlines the objectives of a currently unnamed association (herein: The Association) to define a set of standards and best practices for automated testing in the development of video games and XR applications. For over 30 years, automated testing has been a well-defined practice in Enterprise Software, and has grown to an over $40B industry including tooling, services, and education. It has also resulted in the elevation of the career Automated Quality Assurance professional (aka SDET or Automation Engineer), as a recognized expert in this area.

Meanwhile, Gaming and XR continue to struggle with workplace conditions, end-date-driven release cycles (aka "Crunch"), and the general quality of titles produced due to the massive cost of testing, which is predominately manual in this space. It is long overdue that the Gaming and XR industries followed the example of Enterprise software, and adopted a standard approach to automated testing.

## Scope

These standards will include a framework of activities, roles and responsibilities, and key performance indicators (KPIs) intended to streamline the efforts of organizations looking to adopt automation techniques within their projects.

Similar to the [CISSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC2) certification defined by the [ISC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC2) organization, these standards would be intended to provide a set of guidelines and a roadmap to help teams successfully establish the practice, as well as a certification path for individuals to demonstrate their competency in supporting these efforts. The standards will be defined with input from major game studios, publishers, and testing service providers to ensure a holistic approach, and will be open publicly for comment and to Association members for suggested improvements.

## Activities Framework

A core aspect of any standard is a framework of activities that should be performed. Knowing what work needs to be done helps to prioritize efforts and ensure that no critical activities are missed and that less important activities do not receive undue attention. The framework also defines when those activities should be performed in the development lifecycle.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Relative to the activities framework, the roles and responsibilities definition seeks to define which individuals within a team are performing certain tasks. This should be a loose definition of those responsibilities and is intended to scale with the size of the team. This means a small team might have a handful of individuals responsible for multiple activities within the framework, while a larger team might have individuals or even entire teams focusing on an individual task or activity. The goal here is to define who does the work, to eliminate overlap and waste.

## Key Performance Indicators

Possibly the most important part of any investment in people and process is in understanding the return on that investment. This can be challenging in a quality-focused setting, as it will appear as though little or nothing is broken if the process is meeting it's objectives, providing a false sense of security to key stakeholders who may be inclined to reduce the investment in this area. To quote the "God Entity" in Futurama season 4, episode 8, "**When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all**".

To avoid this pitfall, as well as provide a focal point for continuous improvement, it is important to define a standard set of metrics with which to measure the success of QA, and especially the investments made in automated testing. These should include the cost of implementation, maintenance, execution time (as a measure of efficiency both for optimization and versus manual testing), test coverage, and many more key areas.

## Maturity Model

One way that organizations can manage the adoption of a new practice is through the use of a maturity model. This prevents teams from taking on too much, and ultimately failing. It also provides a clearer path to realistic ROI by providing a roadmap of activities that will build on one another.

## Tooling

An additional aspect of the standardization effort will be to define the tools required to be successful. This is not intended to support any one tool or vendor, but simply to provide a blueprint of tooling capabilities to facilitate a discussion around the appropriate investment regarding these.

## Publication and Socialization

All outcomes of the standardization effort will be published regularly, and feedback encouraged. Where appropriate, Association members will be invited to speak at events to socialize the standards to facilitate wider adoption.

In summary, this proposal is intended to be an effort by and for the greater Quality Assurance (QA) community surrounding video games and XR. Our goal is to provide a framework for success, but also to enhance the career paths, working conditions, and overall professional health of the QA workforce. It is also in the best interest of the publishers and studios who seek to monetize on QA efforts by delivering the best quality product to their consumers, as well as to ensure the longevity and growth of the industry as a whole.
