## Mission and Vision

"We envision a global gaming industry where game testers are respected as essential contributors to the development process. Our association seeks to create a vibrant community where testers can access resources, share knowledge, and build meaningful connections. Through our efforts, we aim to inspire innovation in game testing methodologies, promote inclusivity and diversity, and ultimately ensure that every game released meets the highest quality standards, providing players with immersive and enjoyable experiences."

Our mission is to elevate the role of game testers in the industry, fostering collaboration, and improving the overall quality of gaming experiences. The association aims to provide support, education, and networking opportunities to game testers, while also advocating for their recognition and the adoption of ethical and sustainable practices within the industry.

## Programs and Services

There does not appear to be a single advocacy association targeting Game Testers today. There is one education provider, ISTQB, who provides a [Game Testing certification](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/game-testing), although there appears to be very few training providers who actually support this certification, and none in the US (as of 08-24-2023).

One of our initial goals will be to define a standard curriculum for Game Testing, one that recognizes the breadth and variety of games that can be developed, with a path to include automation that would be made freely available to the Game Tester community via online channels. This curriculum will be developed with input from key stakeholders in the industry such as the studios, publishers, and service providers. Additional training and resources will be identified, defined, and made available through the Association and it's members via partnerships, advertising, and promotion at industry events. The materials developed through the Association will be made available at no charge to Universities and other accredited training organizations, as well as studios and publishers looking to provide a career path for Game Testers.

Additional outcomes of the Association should include delivering Standards and Best Practices, Maturity Models, White Papers, Case Studies, educational videos, and other publications to support the industry as well as organizing or sponsoring industry events.

## Structure

The Association will be classified as a 501(c)(3) non-profit Corporation, which will give us access to tax-deductible donations, grants, and other fundraising opportunities. The Board of Directors and Officers, made up of industry leaders and experts will define our bylaws and governance to ensure transparency and accountability in our decision-making process.

Additional advisors will be enlisted to help with Legal, Marketing, Finance, and other matters. Volunteers from within the industry will provide additional support for events such as webinars, trade shows, and meetups.

## Collaboration and Partnerships

Collaboration and financial support will be sought through donations by publishers, platform providers, tools vendors, and other industry stakeholders. Partnership with educators would be desirable, given the demand for in-person training and recognized certifications. However, this is not required to meet our objective of providing free and open access to the Game Tester community.

## Evaluation and Impact Measurement

The impact of this association will be measured by the demand for our Programs and Services. If we are doing well to define and socialize meaningful standards in the industry, there will be a marked improvement in the career paths, opportunities, and quality of life for Game Testers throughout the industry, as well as the quality of the games that are released.

As such, quarterly reviews will be established to ensure we are making progress towards those goals, and adjustments made as needed.
